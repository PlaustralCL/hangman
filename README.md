# Hangman
Game of hangman for the command line

The purpose of this project was to practice loading and saving files.  The secret
word is sampled from a txt dictionary and the game can be saved as a yaml file and
restarted. A full description can be found at [The Odin Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization-ruby-programming)

You can try the game at [replit.com](https://replit.com/@PlaustralCL/hangman#README.md).

## Reflections
* The actual reading and writing to a file is not difficult. The tricky practice
was making sure that the saved game data was easily incorporated back into the game.
* Still trying to get used to the OOP approach
